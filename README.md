![c++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-c%2B%2B-%2300599C?logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

This repository is made to practice algorithm problems for the coding tests. Majority of the problems are from 
[Baekjoon Online Judge (BOJ)](https://www.acmicpc.net/), and are categorized by the algorithms which participants 
are needed to solve with. </br>

## Guideline
The file must be made with following forms
- `[directory name]/[name]_[#prob in BOJ].cpp`
- `[directory name]/[name]_[#prob in BOJ].py`


## Topics
- [Greedy Algorithm](greedy)
- [Brute Force](brute_force)
